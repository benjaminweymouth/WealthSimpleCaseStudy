Chip Rarity is making hardware difficult / expensive. So I'd recommend that they avoid getting into the hardware market. But maybe into software. 

Maybe they should start their own cryptocurrency like WealthSimpleCOIN. 

More patents, more innovation. Maybe use open source projects, hire new talent. 

MORE collaboration with other companies, projects like the work they are doing with Twitter to integrate their WealthSimple Payment app into the Twitter system archetectrue. (reference WealthSimple Cash Twitter BNN Bloomberg news article here)
