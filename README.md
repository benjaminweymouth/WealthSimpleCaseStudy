## Overview and Origin

In an economic era filled with traditional banking systems, WealthSimple provides a unique case study for analysis because the company represents an alternative path for wealth accumulation. WealthSimple was founded in 2014, and provides financial services relating to trading, investments, cryptocurrencies, portfolio management and tax filing. <sup>[1](#myendnote1)</sup> This analysis is a concise overview of the factors that have led to the rise of a new power in the financial industry: WealthSimple. 

The origins of this relatively new FinTech firm are characterized by hard work and entrepreneurial spirit. One report holds that "from February to August 2014, they worked days, nights and weekends to hire employees and raise millions of dollars in capital investments." <sup>[4](#myendnote4)</sup> The WealthSimple website describes the founders "working together out of WealthSimple CEO Mike Katchen’s apartment." <sup>[2](#myendnote1)</sup> These humble origins are notable, but should be considered alongside other factors in the growth of the company. 

There were three founders of the company: Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler. Each of the three founders had relevant experience in the finance industry, so the idea of a new FinTech company was familiar corporate territory. They amalgamated their work experiences, and diversified their workforce by hiring different employees from established banks and other companies. <sup>[3](#myendnote3)</sup> 
 
Since 2014, WealthSimple has raised $900.4M in funding. <sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> They have achieved this amount of funding from a variety of sources. CrunchBase lists their principal seed investors as a company called Power Financial Corporation, who funded the company during their Series A, B and C rounds. Other investors in WealthSimple include Ryan Reynolds, Drake and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.<sup>[6](#myendnote6)</sup> This is a substantial amount and would indicate that the firm is desirable as an investment, and a suitable choice for further business analysis.  

## Business Activities:

WealthSimple is in the business of creating wealth building opportunities for persons who are willing to accept the risk of a non-traditional financial company. They offer up a new business model which includes online-only service offerings such as investment, trading, bank accounts and a cryptocurrency exchange. Their business architecture is novel because they do not rely upon brick-and-mortar branches to offer these services. 

The WealthSimple creed has been established and it is possible to consider whether or not it is a simple or attainable goal. Their main corporate philosophy is as follows: 

> *“The first is our mission. Which is pretty radical — to completely democratize wealth. To see access to financial freedom as a human right for everyone no matter where you come from or how much money you have.”* <sup>[7](#myendnote7)</sup>


This goals seems to be rooted in a democratic sense, which highlights the universal nature of WealthSimple's corporate philosophy. However, a deeper analysis is required to verify that thier corporate philosophy matches with their products and service offerings. It should be noted that this type of banking is still in it's infancy compared to traditional established in-person banking.  In order to achieve that goal, they provide five service offerings: 

| Service       | Description   | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| WealthSimple Invest      | An investment tool | 
| WealthSimple Trade      | A commission-free stock trading platform      |  
| WealthSimple Crypto | A Cryptocurrency Exchange with insurance coverage      | 
| WealthSimple Cash | A peer-to-peer payment platform     | 
| WealthSimple Tax | A Tax Return platform for analysis and filing      | 

These products and services are geared towards the millenial audience, who may have some finances invested in traditional banks, but have not locked in their savings entirely. This way, WealthSimple would be able to capitalize on that amount and disrupt the traditional investment process. 

In order to acheive this goal, WealthSimple has created a number of new financial products and services that set them apart in the FinTech landscape. In terms of unique products, WealthSimple offers a social responsible ETF, Halal financiing and a fully-insured cryptocurrency exchange. a crypto exchange. <sup>[8](#myendnote8)</sup>

WealthSimple uses both a mobile phone app and a web platform for it's products and service offerings. According to StackShare, they implement the mobile app using a platform called React Native and the website is built with React. However, there are many other technologies used in the creation of their products and an image has been included to display the plethora of technologies used. 

In order to display the breadth of the Wealth Simple Tech Stack, an image has been provided from StackShare: <sup>[9](#myendnote9)</sup>

## Landscape

WealthSimple inhabits a growing economic domain of digital banks who specialize in online trading, cryptocurrency, robo-advising and peer-to-peer payments. This is a novel product portfolio because many firms will only specialize in one or more of these financial products. Thus, WealthSimple's industrial categorization crosses boundaries and places it within a unique market position. 

The Canadian FinTech market has seen many changes over the last decade. One notable trend is the introduction of new financial disruptors, like WealthSimple, who enter a field once previously dominated by established banks and financial institutions. 

The other major Fintech firms who inhabit this disruptive space in Canada include QuesTrade, QTrade and RobinHood. However, while QuesTrade and QTrade are available in Canada, RobinHood is not available to Canadians at this time in 2021. Therefore, WealthSimple has a strategic advantage over comparable firms from an international perspective.  

However, the competitive landscape is not perfectly clear for WealthSimple. FinTechNews holds that while WealthSimple might be Canada's largest robo-advisor, other incumbents, including large Canadian banks, have added robo-advisors to their product and service offerings. <sup>[10](#myendnote10)</sup> These large economic rivals include TD WebBroker, CIBC Investor's Edge and RBC Direct Investing. 

One can conclude then, from the structure of the industry, that WealthSimple will face competition both from traditional banks and smaller corporate rivals like QTrade. The upshot of this current industrial structure is that the Canadian FinTech market is not yet saturated with companies like WealthSimple.  


## Results

In terms of results, WealthSimple has approximately "$9.7 billion in assets under management", which are assets that would otherwise be invested in other FinTech firms, or in established banks. Since this achievement was accomplished in less than a decade, it is prudent to conclude that it has made a significant impact on the Canadian financial industry. However, it is unclear if the current success that the company has acheived will continue or whether it will plateau. 

The results and impact of WealthSimple on the FinTech market have been impressive. However, the Crunchbase website also indicates that in 2021 WealthSimple divested all their U.S. clients in order to focus on the Canadian retail market.<sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> This loss of a client base may indicate a downturn in viability for the company. It is yet to be seen as to whether or not Canadian regulators will initiate further restrictions on the cryptocurrency market. Thus, at the present time, it seems on balance that WealthSimple is part of a highly profitable, yet highly emerging market. A closer analysis with some specific metrics in the next section will allow for a quantitative analysis to be performed. 

The success or failure of a relatively new company in an emerging market like FinTech can be determined by analysing some core metrics. These metrics may include a market valuation, the number of employees, ETF performance and the company's annual revenue. Here is a listing of some of these core metrics for WealthSimple: 

| Metric      | Value / Change  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Market Valuation     |  $5 billion (up from $1.4 billion in October)<sup>[11](#myendnote11)</sup> | 
| Number of employees      |  788 employees (up 39% in 6 months) <sup>[12](#myendnote12)</sup>   |  
| WealthSimple's ETF Performance | +0.61% increase  <sup>[13](#myendnote13)</sup>     | 
| Annual revenue | $33M  <sup>[14](#myendnote14)</sup>   | 

One conclusion that we can draw is that WealthSimple is doing well in it's own right. In an independant analysis, it's market valuation seems to be increasing rapidly, along with it's number of employees. The ETF value is also increasing, which means that the market analysis that WealthSimple provides should give it's customers some gains and economic utility. However, it may also be prudent to analyze how WealthSimple is faring in comparison to the market competitors and incumbants. 

According to the Financial Post, the WealthSimple valuation in May 2021 should be enough for it's competition to be concerned.<sup>[11](#myendnote11)</sup>  According to the website Craft, WealthSimple fares well in terms of employee growth, assets under management, customers, and their latest funding round. <sup>[15](#myendnote15)</sup> However, one complication in terms of the competitive landscape is the idea that FinTech is, as Michael Porter calls is an emerging market. 

This means that the rules of the industry are not yet set, that new corporate players may enter the field, and that economic forces have not yet stabilized. <sup>[15](#myendnote15)</sup> Therefore, the metrics that have been displayed here and the overwhelming economic progress that WealthSimple has made over the past 7 years may not be sustainable. In the next section, some recommendations will be made in order for WealthSimple to maintain their competitive advantage. 

## Recommendations
![WealthCoinPrototypeLogo](/images/WealthCoin.png)

Given this analysis, it is prudent to suggest a recommendation for WealthSimple to maintain their strategic positioning. Thus, this analysis proposes that WealthSimple should develop their own cryptocurrency, and that it should be called "WealthCoin." Since WealthSimple may face international competition, a cryptocurrency may provide it with a competitive advantage. WealthSimple could capitalize on the popularity of cryptocurrency and offer a digital currency specifically for it's Canadian customers. 

The idea of a new cryptocurrency may not seem novel, but other avenues of product diversity may be even more risky. For example, a foray into hardware during an age of semiconductor scarcity is ill-advised. WealthSimple has an exiting customer base that they could market a cryptocurrency to directly. They could engage in more collaborations with other companies, such as are doing with Twitter to integrate their WealthSimple Payment app into the Twitter system architecture. <sup>[17](#myendnote17)</sup> If they develop "WealthCoin", it could lead to the filing of new patents and create new innovation in the Canadian FinTech industry. 

In order to implement a new "WealthCoin" cryptocurrency, WealthSimple would need to employ a number of technologies, similar to the stack employed by Ethereum. Therefore, they would need to implement a data structure that holds a ledger such as BlockChain library, Smart Contracts, cryptography and a distributed peer-to-peer platform. In terms of the actual code, there are many ways to code a BlockChain, such as in C#, GoLang, Python or Rust. <sup>[18](#myendnote18)</sup> 

While this new cryptocurrency would have start up costs associated with it, I would recommend using open-source technologies like Python whenever possible. This would reduce the likelihood of litigation if using a proprietary programming language like C# or Java. Some costs are unavoidable, when scaling up a technology. But the main idea in selecting this type of technology stack would be to insulate the company from any competitors or future costs. 

In conclusion, it is clear that WealthSimple is revolutionary, new and highly disruptive to the established financial services sector. However, their goal of universal wealth is not currently achievable, since their services are only available to Canadians. Since the FinTech industry is currently undergoing rapid and sweeping changes, futher analysis is prudent in order to record the meteoric rise of WealthSimple.
