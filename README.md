## Overview and Origin

The rationale for selecting WealthSimple as a case study is because in an economic era filled with traditional banking systems, WealthSimple provides a unique alternative for wealth accumulation. This analysis is a concise overview of the origins, activities and other factors that have led to the rise of a new power in the financial industry: WealthSimple. 

WealthSimple was founded in 2014, and since then has grown to provide financial services relating to trading, investments, cryptocurrencies, portfolio management and tax filing. <sup>[1](#myendnote1)</sup> It began in the founders apartment with the first 4 employees "since the very beginning of the company in 2014 when there were just four of us working together out of WealthSimple CEO Mike Katchen’s apartment." <sup>[2](#myendnote1)</sup>

There were three founders of the company: Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler. Each of the three founders had previously had other financial services companies, so the idea of a new fintech company was familiar ground. From there, they grew into the space, hiring different employees from estabilshed banks and other companies. <sup>[3](#myendnote3)</sup> The journey to become a successful fintech firm was not an easy one, and one report holds that "from February to August 2014, they worked days, nights and weekends to hire employees and raise millions of dollars in capital investments." <sup>[4](#myendnote4)</sup>
 
As stipulated on CrunchBase, the WealthSimple has raised $900.4M in funding. <sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> They have achieved this amount of funding from a variety of sources. CrunchBase lists their principal seed investors as a company called Power Financial Corporation, who funded the company during their Series A, B and C rounds. Other investors in WealthSimple include Ryan Reynolds, Drake and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.<sup>[6](#myendnote6)</sup> This is a substantial amount and would indicate that the firm is desirable as an investment. 

## Business Activities:

WealthSimple is in the business of creating wealth building opportunities for persons who are willing to accept the risk of a non-traditional financial company. They offer up a new business model which includes online-only service offerings such as investment, trading, bank accounts and a cryptocurrency exchange. Their business architecture is novel because they do not rely upon brick-and-mortar branches to offer these services. It should be noted that this type of banking is still in it's infancy compared to traditional established in-person banking. 

The WealthSimple creed has been established and it is possible to consider whether or not it is a simple or attainable goal. Their main corporate philosophy is as follows: 

> *“The first is our mission. Which is pretty radical — to completely democratize wealth. To see access to financial freedom as a human right for everyone no matter where you come from or how much money you have.”* <sup>[7](#myendnote7)</sup>


In order to achieve that goal, they provide five service offerings: 

| Service       | Description   | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| WealthSimple Invest      | An investment tool | 
| WealthSimple Trade      | A commission-free stock trading platform      |  
| WealthSimple Crypto | A Cryptocurrency Exchange with insurance coverage      | 
| WealthSimple Cash | A peer-to-peer payment platform     | 
| WealthSimple Tax | A Tax Return platform for analysis and filing      | 

These products and services are geared towards the millenial audience, who may have some finances invested in traditional banks, but have not locked in their savings entirely. This way, WealthSimple would be able to capitalize on that amount and disrupt the traditional investment process. 

In order to acheive this goal, WealthSimple has created a number of new financial products and services that set them apart in the fintech landscape. In terms of unique products, WealthSimple offers a social responsible ETF, Halal financiing and a fully-insured cryptocurrency exchange. a crypto exchange. <sup>[8](#myendnote8)</sup>

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The results and impact of WealthSimple on the FinTech market have been impressive. However, the Crunchbase website also indicates that in 2021 WealthSimple divested all their U.S. clients in order to focus on the Canadian retail market. This loss of a client base may indicate a downturn in viability for the company. It is yet to be seen as to whether or not Canadian regulators will initiate further restrictions on the cryptocurrency market. Thus, at the present time, it seems on balance that CrunchBase is part of a highly profitable, yet highly emerging market.

## Recommendations
![WealthCoinPrototypeLogo](/images/WealthCoin.png)

I recommend that WealthSimple develop a new cryptocurrency, and I propose that it be called "WealthCoin." In the age of cryptocurrency, currency is distributed, autonomous and can transcend political or geographical representations. Whether it is traditional currency or not, the main idea of currency is a placeholder for value to facilitate some exchange between two parties. WealthSimple could capitalize on the popularity of cryptocurrency and offer a digital currency specifically for it's Canadian customers. 

The idea of a new cryptocurrency may not seem novel, but other avenues of product diversity may be even more risky. For example, a foray into hardware during an age of semiconductor scarcity is ill-advised. While cryptocurrencies are abundant, WealthSimple has an exiting customer base that they could market this new "WealthCoin" to. If they develop "WealthCoin", they could file for new patents, and create new innovation in the Canadian FinTech industry. They could engage in more collaborations with other companies, projects like the work they are doing with Twitter to integrate their WealthSimple Payment app into the Twitter system architecture. <sup>[10](#myendnote10)</sup> 

In order to implement a new "WealthCoin" cryptocurrency, WealthSimple would need to employ a number of technologies, similar to the stack employed by Ethereum. Therefore, they would need to implement a data structure that holds a ledger such as BlockChain library, Smart Contracts, cryptography and a distributed peer-to-peer platform. In terms of the actual code, there are many ways to code a BlockChain, such as in C#, GoLang, Python or Rust. <sup>[11](#myendnote11)</sup> 

While this new cryptocurrency would have start up costs associated with it, I would recommend using open-source technologies like Python whenever possible. This would reduce the likelihood of litigation if using a proprietary programming language like C# or Java. Some costs are unavoidable, when scaling up a technology. But the main idea in selecting this type of technology stack would be to insulate the company from any competitors or future costs.
