## Overview, Origins and Funding

The rationale for selecting WealthSimple as a case study is because in an economic era filled with traditional banking systems, WealthSimple provides a unique alternative for wealth accumulation. This analysis is a concise overview of the origins, activities and other factors that have led to the rise of a new power in the financial industry: WealthSimple. 

WealthSimple was founded in 2014, and since then has grown to provide financial services relating to trading, investments, cryptocurrencies, portfolio management and tax filing. <sup>[1](#myendnote1)</sup> It began in the founders apartment with the first 4 employees "since the very beginning of the company in 2014 when there were just four of us working together out of WealthSimple CEO Mike Katchen’s apartment." <sup>[2](#myendnote1)</sup>

There were three founders of the company: Michael Katchen, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler. Each of the three founders had previously had other financial services companies, so the idea of a new fintech company was familiar ground. From there, they grew into the space, hiring different employees from estabilshed banks and other companies. <sup>[3](#myendnote3)</sup> The journey to become a successful fintech firm was not an easy one, and one report holds that "from February to August 2014, they worked days, nights and weekends to hire employees and raise millions of dollars in capital investments." <sup>[4](#myendnote4)</sup>
 
As stipulated on CrunchBase, the WealthSimple has raised $900.4M in funding. <sup>[5](#myendnote5)</sup> They have achieved this amount of funding from a variety of sources. CrunchBase lists their principal seed investors as a company called Power Financial Corporation, who funded the company during their Series A, B and C rounds. Other investors in WealthSimple include Ryan Reynolds, Drake and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.<sup>[6](#myendnote6)</sup> This is a substantial amount and would indicate that the firm is desirable as an investment.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

USE: Articles on the major trends in the Canadian / International FinTech market. 



* What are the other major companies in this domain?

-other Fintechs of the same size. see this list and resources in my resources list: QuestTrade, QTrade, etc.

-Traditional Banks, that act as competition

-for competitors, use that Craft Website

-FinTechNews holds that while WealthSimple might be Canada's largest robo-advisor, other incumbants, including large Canadian banks have added robo-advisors to their product and service offerings. <sup>[1](#myendnote1)</sup>


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The results and impact of WealthSimple on the FinTech market have been impressive. However, the Crunchbase website also indicates that in 2021 WealthSimple divested all their U.S. clients in order to focus on the Canadian retail market. This loss of a client base may indicate a downturn in viability for the company. It is yet to be seen as to whether or not Canadian regulators will initiate further restrictions on the cryptocurrency market. Thus, at the present time, it seems on balance that CrunchBase is part of a highly profitable, yet highly emerging market.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Chip Rarity is making hardware difficult / expensive. So I'd recommend that they avoid getting into the hardware market. But maybe into software. 

Maybe they should start their own cryptocurrency like WealthSimpleCOIN. 

More patents, more innovation. Maybe use open source projects, hire new talent. 

MORE collaboration with other companies, projects like the work they are doing with Twitter to integrate their WealthSimple Payment app into the Twitter system archetectrue. (reference WealthSimple Cash Twitter BNN Bloomberg news article here)
